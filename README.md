# Python
This repository contains all of the code I wrote for the Python programming modules I completed in college.

I completed 3 modules on Python programming and these files are broken down into their respective years, semester and week of my college journey.

The module completed in *'Year One - Semester One'* focused heavily on the fundamenals of programming in general and thaught us how to think like a programmer. We also gained experiance with the different aspects of the language by learning about the datatypes, if statements, while loops, sorting algorithms, functions, and other python basics.

The module completed in *'Year One - Semester Two'* explored the language more in depth building on the basics learned in the previous module. Here, we covered more complex topics like running python files, string formatting, classes, Queues and Stacks.

The module completed in *'Year Two - Semester One'* was a module called 'Data Structures and Algorithms'. As you would imagine, this focused further on the datastructures we had covered before, introducing LinkedLists, LinkedStacks, Trees, Binary Search Trees, HashSets and HashMaps. It also gave further emphasis to certain other programming essentials such as recursion, different sorting alorithms than seen in previous modules and graphs.

You can find all of the code on the above topics in these folders in their respective weeks in each module. Natually, the code and topics get more complicated as the weeks go on.
